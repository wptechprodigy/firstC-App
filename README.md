# Guessing Game - My First C# Project

This is part of my decision of learning one of the OOP based languages such as Java, C# and the likes.

I decided on C# after several thoughts and insights from professionals in the industry
who have worked with both great technologies. Some of whom are Coder Foundry CEO, Fredrik Christenson and some others.

## So, I followed a live stream

On Twitch, I followed Brendan Enrick and produced this first project in C#.

It was really amazing. It's amazing that most of the concepts I had learnt about CS and implementation with Javascript and Typescript are more or less same in C#.

## The Game

The game is a guessing game that has a lower boundary set as 1 and upper boundary provided by the player.

The game implements `Binary Search` - _Divide and Conquer principle_ - to guess a randomly generated number within the set boundaries.

And in few guesses, the program will guess the generated number.

It's fun and I enjoy it.

### How Do I Run the Game

Clone the project.

Ensure you have your dotnet setup correctly. Then run...

```
dotnet run
```

If everything goes well as they should, you'll see a prompt to set an upper boundary. Enter a boundary, a number remember.

Then hit `Enter`.

Sit back and watch the game do its thing.

Hope you'll find it interesting.

## What Next?

On the 1st of April, I benefited from the **FREE ACCESS** provided by [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com) to their over 7000 learning resources because of the `COVID-19` pandemic that raving all the corners of the globe.

I registered for `Scott Allen` C# course to learn more on it and build something.

## Credits

So much thanks to the great community of awesome software engineers we have globally and especially, on this, to Brendan Enrick and the team at Pluralsight.
